***Warning**: This is not a complete project. Because of lack of data both training and validation accuracy is less*.
# Introduction
I used to work with scientific spectral data and thought of applying machine learning in these data. In this project I have taken powder xrd specral data to classify data into seven crystal systems. The powder xrd spectrum has two main sequence a 2theta angle in *x* axis and intensity in *y* axis. I converted this sequence data into a tensor data to pass it as an image in a convolution model.
